# spark_gradient_descent

The goal of this project was to implement gradient descent for ols regression, with and without regularization, in a distributed fashion with PySpark. This data was made available through the UC Irvine public repository of Machine Learning datasets by researchers at the University of Minho in association with this paper:

P. Cortez, A. Cerdeira, F. Almeida, T. Matos and J. Reis. Modeling wine preferences by data mining from physicochemical properties. In Decision Support Systems, Elsevier, 47(4):547-553, 2009.

This dataset contains data on various features of portugese wines, as well as a numeric outcome variable - quality. The machine learning task is to predict quality from features that describe the wine such as color, acidity, and alcohol content. Through this project, I learned about the benefits of regularization and how ridge and lasso regression differ, while also practicing my skills coding in PySpark.

This project file was adapted from a homework that I completed in my masters program for my 'Machine Learning at Scale' class, where I am currently learning PySpark.

This project is provided as a pdf, as well as a jupyter notebook.
